# Movie_Recommendation_System

In this project, I have created a Movie recommendation system in Jupyter notebook using 2 data sets, one of which is a collection of data on the different movies with their own movie id and their genre and the other dataset is the one which has the data on different users rating on different movies.

The datasets can be downloaded from the following link : https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFNydTJEckpUZ25iWGs1emptX0dBVkQ4ajJUd3xBQ3Jtc0ttQzRZUmlWZEJDVXFxRjNEb21nWFhqVWZsa1k0clFRM1UxcnhMcUNxald0alNBYk11ZnU4SnQ0ZThrMGpBOFdDMEw2ZkQ3WUxmNUJtTGVHQ3I0dlJwZ2VKQ0o5am9veHljbEhfNGJHTkRKSXo3XzdFQQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.grouplens.org%2Fdatasets%2Fmovielens%2Fml-25m.zip&v=eyEabQRBMQA
